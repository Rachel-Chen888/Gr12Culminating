# Culminating Project

Welcome to your final project in ICS4U. The goal of this project is to showcase all the skills you have picked up throughout this course. As such, this assignment is open-ended on purpose.

You will choose a project to complete and document your progress (similar to the Animal Survival Game). What you decide to do is completely up to you, but I have provided some suggestions below. The only stipulation is that your project **must** use object-oriented principles, aka classes, 

## Part 1: Planning
Create a planning document to help you flesh out the details of your project idea. You should include a brief 2-3 sentence explaination of what your program is going to do. You should also consider including class diagrams to help you think about the methods and variables you will need in each class. You can create diagrams similar to the ones shown in the Greatreads assignment.

Once you've determined your project, please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/zojYKhm8nL5FHLnb8) to let me know what you've chosen.

## Part 2: Coding!
The bulk of this project is, of course, coding! You should also make a new copy of the [work log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Lyp5yKxueuEZLUFLtyZGYnBooQ3kX-2ucBoa7sDKh0/copy) document (you can ignore the "responsibilities" section). As you work on your code, document your progress. Make sure to indicate any errors/issues, tasks you complete, and "next steps/to do list" as you work on the project. Note that there is also a reflection paragraph at the bottom of the work log, this should be completed as well.

### Project Ideas
The following ideas are meant to be starting points - the specifics of implementation are up to you. It may help to think of a "client" or "customer" to build for - this could be a friend, family member, teacher, yourself, etc.

- banking or financial app
- health and/or fitness app
- cyberbullying awareness app
- grade tracking app (for students OR teachers)
- number system converter app
- appointment/event organizer app
- app for personal collections (recipes, antiques, coins, etc)
- travel help or planner app
- technical support/training help
- contact book app
- currency converter
- a game using Swing
- an idea of your choice, to be confirmed by me.

## What To Hand In
Upload to Brightspace: Your Planning document from Part 1, and your Work Log from Part 2. 
Your code should remain on Github.

## Marking Scheme

### Knowledge & Understanding /5
- Appropriate use of variables, conditionals, loops, and methods
- Variable data types are accurately defined

### Thinking /10
- Planning document shows evidence of organizing the project with thoughtful consideration given to personal capabilities and time limitations
- No unnecessary or unused variables, conditionals, loops, etc.

### Application /10
- Use of Object-Oriented Programming in the approach to the solution
- Working solution; program does not generate any errors (syntax/compiler, logic errors, etc.)
- Entire project is submitted on time

### Communication /10
- Work Log document is well-detailed. It is easy to follow your progress as you complete the project. Any problems/issues/roadblocks and their solutions are documented
- Code is well-documented with comments. Code formatting is neat (indentation, whitespace) and consistent across all classes
- Variable names are clear and concise
